# Message Bus Example pulled from [Sean Ballais's Blog](http://seanballais.github.io/blog/implementing-a-simple-message-bus-in-cpp/)

## reason
I wanted to learn how to build a message bus system and this tutorial looked simple enough
And also just wanting to practice my cpp

## differences
* put class declarations into `.hpp` files and definitions in `.cpp` files 

* `Makefile` to practice using make and building 

## building

1. Make

```sh
$ make
```
## Useage

```sh
$./bus
```

this'll output a message like 50 times
